COSCUP has been expanding international connections, overseas speakers, and sponsorships through community collaborations. We invite communities to join us in securing more resources and maximizing exposure. Along with existing sponsorship benefits, additional perks will be offered to COSCUP and partner communities.

@Benefits Provided by COSCUP

- The official website will feature a dedicated community page displaying the unique sponsor logos, highlighting their support for specific communities.

@Benefits Provided by Partner Communities

- COSCUP will assist in printing double-sided table flags featuring the sponsor’s logo, which can be placed at session tracks or booths.
- Communities can verbally promote the sponsor at their booth to enhance brand exposure.

Details on implementation and rules will be announced in April. Interested sponsors and communities can refer to the [COSCUP Blog – 2024 sponsorship model](https://blog.coscup.org/2024/04/coscup-2024-customized-community.html) or contact [sponsorship@coscup.org](mailto:sponsorship@coscup.org) for discussion. We welcome community partners to collaborate in securing resources and sponsors to support their communities’ participation in COSCUP!
