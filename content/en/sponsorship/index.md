## FAQ

### Besides the current sponsorship plan, can I sponsor other projects or items?

- Yes, contact us at [sponsorship@coscup.org](mailto:sponsorship@coscup.org) to create custom sponsorship packages.

### Our company would like to have a booth at COSCUP. Which sponsorship level should we choose?

- Please choose "Gold," "Diamond," or "Titanium," and then select the booth level.
  Physical booths allow for interaction with attendees, and COSCUP will also prepare activities for attendees to visit each booth. Sponsors can get to know the attendees better through surveys and giveaways, which is a great way to recruit talents and deepen the impression of attendees.
  The booth is a popular option for additional purchases. However, due to the limited number of booths, only Gold-level sponsors or above have the right to purchase booths.

### How are the logos of the sponsors listed on the website? How are the booths chosen?

- To ensure the placement of sponsor logos and maintain fairness, the ranking of logo displays and booth selection is determined based on the “sponsorship level” and “the order of sponsorship payments received”.
  For Gold-level sponsors who have purchased a booth, the logo of the earliest paid sponsor will be ranked first, and the booth location will be selected first.

### Can sponsors request the personal information of the participants?

- COSCUP does not provide personal information of attendees to sponsors.
  The organizers allow sponsors to conduct marketing activities, distribute souvenirs, recruit talent, and collect attendees' personal information with their consent at the booth.

### Why don't I see a physical brochure or an opportunity to place pamphlets?

- COSCUP has been going paperless for the past few years (Let's save some trees\!) Attendees can access the agenda via the website and OPass app.
  In addition to the “Friends" level of sponsorship, other levels of sponsorship will receive an electronic version of the advertisement, which will be displayed as users browse the agenda (the frequency of ads will vary based on the sponsorship level) For greater exposure, you are welcome to purchase additional ads on the agenda page of the website.

### Can unused sponsorship benefits be refunded?

- If the sponsorship benefits are not utilized within the year (no materials provided), they will be regarded as relinquished and are non-refundable.

### What’s OCF?

- OCF, short for [Open Culture Foundation](https://ocf.tw/en/), is a non-profit organization that helps communities access administrative and financial services. COSCUP 2025 is co-organized with the Open Culture Foundation (OCF) to issue sponsorship receipts, electronic invoices, sponsorship contracts, and other legal documents.
